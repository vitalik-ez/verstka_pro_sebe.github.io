        <p>I also like to ride a bike. I usually drive at least 50 km a day. Cycling develops me not only physically but also spiritually. Who skates knows how it affects the overall emotional state. Immediately thoughts disappear, obsessive ideas recede into the background, mood improves.</p></div>

        <div><div class = "center_image"><img class = "camera" src = "pictures/foto.png"></div><p>Taking pictures is one of my favorite hobbies. It is very nice and fun. My personal and great way to relax is to walk around the city with a camera in my hands and take pictures of the city's special moments.</p>
        <p>Photography helps me forget my worries and see the beauty of everyday life. This is the best way to stop the moment and catch the moment that can stay with me forever and. It's a great feeling when you get a good shot and can share it with other people. Here are some of my works.</p></div>
